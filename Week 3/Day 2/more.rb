# 1) Loop through an array of strings, print the first letter of each word *(use an Each loop)


# 2) Loop through an array of numbers, and sum the numbers together, print the final sum at the end of the loop (use the While loop)

# 3) Loop from 1 to 1000 (inclusive), and print out multiples of 100, and for every multiple of 250 print "$250" (use a normal for loop)

# 4) nest a while loop within a for loop. Use the first array of strings (in exercise 1), after looping through each word in the array, use the while loop to loop through each character in that word and print the 3rd character
